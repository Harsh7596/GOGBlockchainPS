## Overview

This project provides a smart contract for skill-based credentialing, where course providers can issue verifiable digital certificates to students. The contract ensures that certificates can be verified for authenticity and can be revoked if necessary.

## Smart Contract Details

### Certificate Structure

```solidity
struct Certificate {
    string courseName;
    string studentName;
    uint256 issueDate;
    bool valid;
}
```

- **courseName**: The name of the course.
- **studentName**: The name of the student who completed the course.
- **issueDate**: The timestamp when the certificate was issued.
- **valid**: A boolean value indicating whether the certificate is still valid.

### Mapping

```solidity
mapping(bytes32 => Certificate) public certificates;
```

- Maps a unique certificate hash to a `Certificate` struct.

## Functions

### `issueCertificate`

```solidity
function issueCertificate(string memory _courseName, string memory _studentName) public returns (bytes32);
```

- **Purpose**: Issues a new certificate to a student.
- **Parameters**:
  - `_courseName`: The name of the course.
  - `_studentName`: The name of the student.
- **Returns**: The certificate hash (`bytes32`) which uniquely identifies the certificate.
- **Emits**: `CertificateIssued` event.

### `revokeCertificate`

```solidity
function revokeCertificate(bytes32 _certHash) public;
```

- **Purpose**: Revokes an existing certificate.
- **Parameters**:
  - `_certHash`: The hash of the certificate to revoke.
- **Emits**: `CertificateRevoked` event.

### `verifyCertificate`

```solidity
function verifyCertificate(bytes32 _certHash) public view returns (bool);
```

- **Purpose**: Verifies if a certificate is still valid.
- **Parameters**:
  - `_certHash`: The hash of the certificate to verify.
- **Returns**: `true` if the certificate is valid, `false` otherwise.

## Events

### `CertificateIssued`

```solidity
event CertificateIssued(bytes32 indexed certHash, string courseName, string studentName);
```

- Triggered when a new certificate is issued.
- **Parameters**:
  - `certHash`: The unique hash of the certificate.
  - `courseName`: The name of the course.
  - `studentName`: The name of the student.

### `CertificateRevoked`

```solidity
event CertificateRevoked(bytes32 indexed certHash);
```

- Triggered when a certificate is revoked.
- **Parameters**:
  - `certHash`: The unique hash of the certificate.

## How to Use

### 1. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) for local blockchain testing
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) for interacting with the contract

### 2. Compile the Contract

```bash
truffle compile
```

### 3. Deploy the Contract

Deploy the contract to a local or test network:

```bash
truffle migrate --network development
```

### 4. Interact with the Contract

Use a script or a frontend interface to interact with the contract:

- **Issue Certificate**: Call `issueCertificate` with the course name and student name.
- **Revoke Certificate**: Call `revokeCertificate` with the certificate hash.
- **Verify Certificate**: Call `verifyCertificate` with the certificate hash.

## Security Considerations

- Ensure only authorized entities can issue and revoke certificates.
- Consider implementing role-based access control if required.
